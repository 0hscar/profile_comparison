# Business Profile Comparator

This project is a business profile comparator tool as an extension to an application. It allows users to compare their restaurant or business profile with nearby and similar businesses, leveraging AI-generated insights and data from Google/Serper. The app features a modern Vue.js frontend and a Django backend with AI integration. Note, no database included as this would be an addon to an existing system.

## Ver0.3

### Scope:
- **AI-powered business profile**.
  - Modern Chat style Assistant. CHECK
  - Interaction through a single input field. CHECK
  - Streaming responses. SHOULD BE WORKING, BUT NOT ATM
- **Profile Analysis**.
  - Ask AI assistant to analyze your business profile, such as: CHECK
    - "What are my strengths?"
    - "What are my weaknesses?"
    - "How can I improve my profile?"
    - Profile completeness.
    - And more.
- **Competitor Insights**.
  - User request for competitor insights and comparison. CHECK
  - Either directly compare against nearby or similar from a seperate list. CHECK
  - Direclty ask AI assistant for insights on competitors. CHECK
  - AI Assistant can make suggestions / summarize based on competitor data. CHECK
- **Actionable Insights**.
  - AI assistant can provide actionable insights based on the analysis of your profile and competitors. CHECK
  - For example:
    - "To improve your profile, consider adding more photos."
    - "Your competitors have more reviews, consider encouraging customers to leave feedback."
- **Content Generation**. (Only text for now as stuff such as images are not included in the MVP). CHECK
  - Social media post captions. CHECK
  - Responses to reviews. CHECK
  - Promotional messages. CHECK
- **What if scenarios**. CHECK
  - AI assistant can generate "what if" scenarios based on user input.
- **Welcome & Guidance**.
  - The chat starts with a friendly welcome message and example questions for new users, It's AI = The sky's the limit.

### Out of Scope:
- **Database**: This is designed as an addon to an existing system, no database included.
- **Web Scraping**: Not included in the MVP, but can be added later for more data sources. (browse.ai recommended. MIGHT BE ADDED IF TIME ALLOWS)
- **Charts & Images**: Not included in the MVP, but can be added later for visualizing data - AI generated.
- **No seperate "AI suggestions", "what if", "Profile assistant" etc.**: All of these are now handled by a single chat assistant.
- **Social media integration**: Not included in the MVP, but can be added later for posting content directly to social media platforms.


### Future Improvements / Features:
- **Context injection for AI**
  - Inject user profile data, competitor data, and other relevant information into the AI prompt for more accurate responses.
- **Continously updating Gamification system**.
- **Automatic AI made changes**.
- **Social media integration** Includes AI generated posts from scratch and more.


### User Experience:
- User opens the app and have a slideout profile including AI assistant, nearby and similar restaurants.
- The main content is the AI assistant chat interface.
- User can ask questions, request insights, or compare their profile with nearby/similar restaurants.
- The user gets a quick access AI assistant that can handle various tasks related to their business profile (AI handled changes as future feature)
- Track badges / achievements for completed tasks, such as profile analysis, competitor insights, and content generation, profile improvements, etc.

# OLD BELOW
## Ver0.2 OLD ALREADY
### TODO:
- **Streaming responses to the frontend**
- **Change AI Suggestions, Assistant etc etc to a singular chat assistant that does both.**

## Still to do. OLD VERSION

- **Testing:** Add full unit tests for both backend and frontend components, edge cases and error handling. No more 404 errors caused by empty variables.
- **bug fixes:** Address any known issues or bugs. Known bugs include:
  - Double API call on direct compare from nearby/similar list.
  - If input searched a second time, competitor query get's wild and ignores location/address
  - Some UI elements overlap.
- **Mandatory Features:** AI response formating.
- **Mandatory Cleanup:** Codebase cleaning

## Fixed bugs. OLD VERSION

- **Nearby restaurants bug**

## Performance fixes

- **Changed to response.parse:** Faster OpenAI responses

- **Streaming AI Response**
- **Potential REST Framework**
- **Web Scraping**: Image size checks, Menu and Open hours, Online reservation
- **Instead of Web Scraping**: browse.ai . Does the scraping for you
- **Charts:** Either AI generated or coded.
- **Country Codes:** Mapping country codes "fi": "Finland",

### Not visible for user OLD VERSION

- **Double API call on direct compare via nearby / similar list**
- **After change to response.parse -> location / address gets ignored on OpenAI call. CRUCIAL FIX BEFORE LAUNCH**

## Scope. OLD VERSION

- Serper API (Google) + AI (GPT 4.1-mini) generated suggestions, comparison and extra insights
- Either choose from a list of nearby / similar restaurant. Or Search for multiple by name or "thai food". Direct search also available. Simple UI implemented to achieve this
- Designed as a slap-on slide-in feature for an existing Vue app
- response.parse OpenAI call used for faster response times and structured returns
-- Caching prompts, responses and fetched data from Serper API.
-- Feeds changeable data last into the AI prompt as OpenAI auto caches and it redoes it when it finds changed data.

## Fixed and passed tests. OLD VERSION

- Results.spec.js
- ComparatorSlideout.spec.js
- InputForm.spec.js
- RestaurantCard.spec.js
- SidebarRestaurantList.spec.js

## Explain. OLD VERSION
- temperature. the lesser number minimized changeability in repsonses. Less varying answers, can be experimented with
- csrf_exempt protects from unauthorized third party sites.

## Left out. OLD VERSION
- Chart generation/ visualization. -> future
- Preview improvements using the AI generated content. --> Is a future feature in my mind, doesn't fit in a MVP
- Web Scraping --> A massive improvement as LLMs based on limited data can get things wrong -> browse.ai recommended
- Running modern local models if infrastructure can support it.
